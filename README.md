## PaaS HAProxy Release

This is an extended version of the HAProxy release, which is part of the [CloudFoundry cf-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release). It was created as its own repository as we only intend to fork the HAProxy part of the cf-release, and at the time of writing had no intention to merge our changes upstream.
